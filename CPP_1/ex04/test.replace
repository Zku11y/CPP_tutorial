The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen unBOMBOCLAAAATed States of America,
 When in the Course of human events, BOMBOCLAAAAT becomes necessary for one people to dissolve
  the polBOMBOCLAAAATical bands which have connected them wBOMBOCLAAAATh another, and to assume
   among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which
    the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entBOMBOCLAAAATle them, a decent respect
     to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the
      causes which impel them to the separation.

We 
hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
 that they are endowed by their Creator wBOMBOCLAAAATh certain unalienable Rights,
  that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuBOMBOCLAAAAT of Happiness.--That 
  to secure these rights, Governments are instBOMBOCLAAAATuted among Men, deriving 
  their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any
   Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, BOMBOCLAAAAT is the Right 
   of the People to alter or to abolish BOMBOCLAAAAT, and to instBOMBOCLAAAATute new Government,
    laying BOMBOCLAAAATs foundation on such principles and organizing BOMBOCLAAAATs powers in such 
    form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and 
    Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established
     should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly 
     all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, 
     while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the 
     forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and
      usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to 
      reduce them under absolute Despotism, BOMBOCLAAAAT is their right, BOMBOCLAAAAT is their duty,
       to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future 
       securBOMBOCLAAAATy.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such 
       is now the necessBOMBOCLAAAATy which constrains them to alter their former Systems of 
       Government. The history of the present King of Great BrBOMBOCLAAAATain is a history of
        repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment
         of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submBOMBOCLAAAATted to a candid world.
